# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions to data structures and algorithm problems. They are primarily drawn from LeetCode and are organized by data structure and solution pattern.

The goal of this repository is not to collect as many solutions as possible, but to practice and document clear efficient approaches to common data structure and algorithm problems while emphasizing on growth, correctness, readability, and trade-offs.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Tables
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Search Trees
- Graphs (BFS / DFS)
- Recursion
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- And More

---

## 🧠 Approach

For most problems, solutions include:
- A thought process to solve the problem
- A brief explanation of the approach
- Key insights or invariants
- Time and space complexity analysis
- In some cases, multiple solutions will be shown (ex: brute force  to a more optimized)

Solutions are written with clarity in mind and are intended to reflect how I reason through problems rather than just final answers.
